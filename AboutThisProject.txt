# FriendList App
## Project Overview
### Duration: November 25, 2023 - November 26, 2023

During this revision, I aimed to reinforce my understanding of the MERN stack, particularly Tailwind CSS. Having temporarily paused project development 
due to exams, I decided to create a simple CRUD app to solidify my skills. This project encompasses essential features like Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations.

## Features

- **Create:** Add friends with their name, birthDate, photo, and an optional description.
- **Read:** View the list of friends with their details.
- **Update:** Modify friend details, including name, birthday, photo, and description.
- **Delete:** Remove friends from the list.

## Project Details

This app allows users to manage a list of friends, each having a name, birthday, and an optional description. 
Additionally, users can upload a photo for each friend.

I utilized the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) for the backend, and Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforced MERN stack concepts.
- Gained proficiency in Tailwind CSS for modern and responsive styling.
- Implemented CRUD operations for a more comprehensive understanding of backend development.

Feel free to explore the app and provide feedback for further improvements.
